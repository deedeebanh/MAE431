# MAE431
MAE 431 Heat Transfer Final Project

Simulation of heat applied on a long beam. Developed a numerical solution of temperature distribution within a long beam using different value of mesh, size and time step. Analyzed the effect on stability and sensitivity of the solution within the slab as time progresses, and determined how long it takes before a steady-state solution is obtained, the maximum temperature in the slab, and where it is located. Used MATLAB for coding and simulation.
